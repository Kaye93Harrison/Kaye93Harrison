## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm a data scientist with a strong background in computer vision and natural language processing (NLP), primarily using TensorFlow and Keras. My work focuses on developing deep learning models that help machines interpret images, text, and patterns in meaningful ways.

In the realm of computer vision, Iâ€™ve worked on projects involving image classification, object detection, segmentation, and facial recognition. I enjoy the challenge of transforming raw image data into actionable insights, and Iâ€™m always experimenting with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and pre-trained architectures to push performance further.

In natural language processing, Iâ€™ve built models for tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, text classification, and language modeling. Using techniques like word embeddings, sequence models (LSTM/GRU), and attention mechanisms, I aim to build models that understand context and nuance in human language.

This repository is a collection of projects, experiments, and practical implementations that reflect my ongoing exploration in AI and deep learning. Here, youâ€™ll find Jupyter notebooks, reusable modules, and end-to-end pipelines built with TensorFlow and Keras. I also document key learnings, model performance metrics, and insights on fine-tuning and deployment strategies.

I'm passionate about clean, reproducible code and transparent model development. I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and learning collaboratively. Whether you're a fellow data scientist, student, or developer curious about machine learning, I hope this repository offers value and inspiration.

Thanks for visiting! Feel free to explore the code, leave feedback, or contribute. I'm always open to discussions and collaboration opportunities. Letâ€™s continue advancing the field of AIâ€”one model at a time.
